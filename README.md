# Huge props
* to [Nicole Sullivan](http://www.stubbornella.org/) ([@Stubbornella](https://twitter.com/#!/stubbornella)) for the original [OOCSS](http://oocss.org/) framework, from which I borrowed liberally.
* to [TJ Holowaychuk](http://tjholowaychuk.com) for [stylus](https://github.com/LearnBoost/stylus), and for [nib](https://github.com/visionmedia/nib) from which I also borrowed liberally.
